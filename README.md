YouTube... but Blockbuster seeks to fix the YouTube experience according to my specific niche needs.

I, like everyone, like to watch YouTube. In particular, I like to watch very, very long videos like the Chris-Chan documentary by [Geno Samuel](https://www.youtube.com/@genosamuel2.1) or the Nickelodeon documentaries by [Quinton Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/@QuintonReviews). This is a fun hobby, but it is certainly not very good for my productivity. Although I have tried to combat this by swearing off YouTube or using extensions like [Unhook](https://unhook.app/), I feel like these only temporarily help, so I am seeking to redefine how I use YouTube.

YouTube... but Blockbuster is a Python app that limits how much YouTube you watch by treating a YouTube video like a VHS or DVD rented from a video store. You can only watch one video per day. If you haven't watched yesterday's video, you don't get to get a different one. Watch your video, delete it, wait until tomorrow for another. The list of videos is cultivated from your list of subscriptions--it offers the newest video from each of the channels you subscribe to. As such, it makes sense to subscribe to maybe a dozen or two dozen channels with good content. If you already watched all the latest videos, check again tomorrow.

This is far from perfect, but I think it's a nice step towards a more "pull-based" method to consume video content.
